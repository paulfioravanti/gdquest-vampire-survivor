# GDQuest Vampire Survivor

This repo is my sandbox for the
[Your First 2D GAME From Zero with GODOT 4! Vampire Survivor Style][] video
tutorial by [GDQuest][]. The original project files can be found
[here][Project files].

I completed the tutorial using [Godot][] 4.3. The original assets provided in
the project files are in this repo as well, but the status of their licenses are
unknown. I am making the assumption that they are MIT.

## Prerequisites

Download and install Godot, either via [direct download][], or with your
favourite package manager (e.g. `brew install godot`)

## Install

```console
git clone https://github.com/paulfioravanti/gdquest-vampire-survivor.git
```

Then, open Godot, press the Import button, navigate to the
`gdquest-vampire-survivor` directory, and select it to import and open the
project.

## Run

Press the Play button in the top right hand corner of the Godot user interface,
or use the `Command-B`/`Control-B` shortcut.
